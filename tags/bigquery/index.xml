      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever needed to copy tables from one project or dataset to another in BigQuery, the below script may be a good option for you.
There are many options for copying tables in BigQuery, ranging from completely non-technical (point and click in the BigQuery UI) to more technical (command line and/or Python scripts).
I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the pros and cons of each option, or why you would want to use one over the other.</description>

      <title>Updating Google Analytics Hit-Level Custom Dimensions in BigQuery</title>

      <description>I recently had a client with a problem. There was an issue with their Google Tag Manager implementation that prevented the collection of certain hit-level custom dimensions to Google Analytics.
Fortunately, they had GA360 (with the export to BigQuery already enabled), and the missing custom dimension information was able to be replicated based on the page path. In other words, I could create a lookup table table based on the page path of the hit to grab the corresponding custom dimension value (in this particular case, it was a custom dimension named Site ID).</description>
