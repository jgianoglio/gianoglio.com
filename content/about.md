Hi, I'm Jim Gianoglio. I'm a Lead Data Scientist at [Bounteous](https://www.bounteous.com), where I get to play with web analytics and digital marketing data every day.

I graduated in 2018 from Carnegie Mellon University with a Master of Science in Information Technology (Business Intelligence & Data Analytics). 

I love to learn new things, and I love to teach. That's one of the main reasons for this blog. It gives me an excuse to try new things, experiment a bit, and share what I've learned along the way.

I'm always happy to chat - you can usually find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jgianoglio) or the [Measure Slack](https://www.measure.chat/).
