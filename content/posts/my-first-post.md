As the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I donâ€™t know if I have a thousand blog posts in me, but I have to start somewhere ðŸ™‚

I plan to mostly write on topics related to analytics, data science, and machine learning. Iâ€™ve built up a lot of knowledge over the years on specific tools, like Google Analytics, Google Tag Manger, and BigQuery. So I imagine Iâ€™ll write about those tools and platforms specifically, in addition to other rants and thoughts on the broader, data-related topics.

I might also venture off occasionally on completely unrelated topics of interest, like coffee or cycling.

Iâ€™d be happy if you join me on this journey. Hopefully weâ€™ll learn from each other along the way...
